## ðŸ§± Database Design

The sample database `shopdb` contains two tables:

### 1. Customers

| Column Name   | Data Type    | Description             |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| `customer_id` | INT (PK)     | Unique customer ID      |
| `customer_name` | VARCHAR(100) | Name of the customer    |
| `email`       | VARCHAR(100) | Email of the customer   |

### 2. Orders

| Column Name   | Data Type     | Description                        |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| `order_id`    | INT (PK)      | Unique order ID                   |
| `customer_id` | INT (FK)      | References `customers.customer_id` |
| `order_date`  | DATE          | Date when order was placed        |
| `amount`      | DECIMAL(10,2) | Total amount of the order         |

The relationship is one-to-many:
- One customer can have many orders.
- Orders belong to one customer.
